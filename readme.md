_Plot your auth.log access attempts on a map of the world. Hopefully someday it will become a fullblown threat intelligence tool. But that won't be overnight._

## To-Do: 

- [ ] Documentation 
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] CI/CD
- [X] Use sqlite 
- [ ] Web interface with leaflet, react(?)
- [ ] Map layer to toggle on/off connections coming from a known VPN server, Tor exit nodes, etc
- [ ] Proper command line interface, likely with [click](https://github.com/pallets/click)
